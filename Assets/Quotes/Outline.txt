Level 1 - Find Macbeth

	Intro
MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
WEIRD SISTERS
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
MACBETH 
But the king yet lives: why do you dress me 
In borrow'd robes? 

	In-Game
MACBETH
    My dearest love, King Duncan comes to-night.
LADY MACBETH
    And when goes hence?
MACBETH
    To-morrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH
    O, never
    Shall sun that morrow see!
    Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
    Must be provided for: and you shall put
    This night's great business into my dispatch.

Level 2 

	Intro
MACBETH
    If we should fail?
LADY MACBETH
    We fail!
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
    And we'll not fail.

	In-Game
LADY MACBETH
				When Duncan is asleep--
	What cannot you and I perform upon
    The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
    Of our great quell?
MACBETH
	Will it not be received,
	When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
	Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
	That they have done't?
	

Level 3

	Intro
MACBETH
	I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
	Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
	That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
		
	In-Game
LADY MACBETH
	The raven himself is hoarse
	That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
	Under my battlements. 

	Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, 
	unsex me here,
	And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty! 

	make thick my blood;

	Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
	That no 
	compunctious 
	visitings of nature
	Shake my fell purpose, 
	nor keep peace between
	The effect and it! 

	Come to my woman's breasts,
	And take my milk for gall, 
	you murdering ministers,
	Wherever in your
	sightless 
	substances
	You wait on nature's mischief! 

	Come, thick night,
	And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,

	That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
	Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
	To cry 'Hold, hold!'

	Outro
MACBETH
	This is a sorry sight.
Lady Macbeth
	My hands are of your colour; but I shame
	To wear a heart so white.
							I hear a knocking--

	After that
MACBETH
	Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
